We pride ourselves on achieving the best possible outcomes and quality of care – whether that involves home health for managing chronic conditions or injury or illness, hospice care to provide end-of-life care and comfort or private care aimed at helping people remain safe and independent at home.

## Personal Care

Klarus Personal Care now offers the highest quality, clinical care on a per visit basis for those individuals that do not need or qualify for Medicare covered home health.

Klarus derives from the Latin word “clàrus”, meaning “clear, bright, respected, upstanding one”. We continually work to think outside-the-box, invent better ways to provide care, and serve as a resource to our patients, families and referral sources.

Our Klarus teams are focused on delivering quality care at a personal level. We get to know the people we serve, and design our care around each patient’s specific needs. The local communities we serve – and the patients and families who are our neighbors – are the top priority in everything we do.

Physicians and hospitals can easily refer patients, update orders and monitor patient progress. Physician groups, health plans and other providers turn to us to help provide the best possible outcomes, manage care and reduce costs.
